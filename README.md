## ‚ùì FAQ

**Why use RustDesk instead of TightVNC?**  
RustDesk is open-source, encrypted, and performs better across platforms.

**How secure are the credentials?**  
Passwords are random and encrypted; keys are transmitted over HTTPS.

**What if the script hangs?**  
Check `%TEMP%\sipcorp_install.log`. Common causes: antivirus or network issues.

**Can I customize notification channels?**  
Yes ‚Äî modify the `Initialize-CredentialFile` function.

**ARM64 Windows support?**  
Partial. Update download URLs for ARM builds manually.

**How do I uninstall everything?**  
Uninstall via *Settings ‚Üí Apps*, remove registry keys, or delete RustDesk service:
```cmd
sc delete RustDesk
```

---

## üß© Troubleshooting

- **Installation Hang:** Check log file in `%TEMP%\sipcorp_install.log`.  
- **Password Not Applied:**  
  ```powershell
  & "$env:ProgramFiles\RustDesk\rustdesk.exe" --password [YOUR_PASSWORD]
  ```
- **Notification Failure:** Test webhook manually (Postman).  
- **Permission Errors:** Always run as Administrator.
